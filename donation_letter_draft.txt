Program Focus & Our Commitment: The purpose of this trip is to engage in ethical, community-guided global health learning while supporting locally identified service projects in Malawi. As medical students, our focus is on learning from Malawian clinicians and communities, building cultural humility, and contributing in ways that are sustainable and respectful.

We aim to return with knowledge, skills, and perspective that will strengthen our care for underserved populations in West Virginia and beyond.












The following pages outline who we are, what we will do, and how community support makes this work possible.
Introduction:

In April 2026, a team of 16 medical students from Marshall University’s Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine will travel to rural northern Malawi for a 3.5-week service-learning experience. Led by the student leadership of our Global & Rural Medicine Interest Group, this program marks the first opportunity in several years for Marshall medical students to return to an international clinical rotation following pandemic-related pauses. We are grateful for the opportunity to reestablish this partnership and to do so with strong student interest and faculty support.

Who We Are:
Medical students from Marshall University
Diverse backgrounds in medicine, pharmacy, public health
Multiple students have traveled to Malawi previously and are returning to complete their malaria research 
Faculty-supervised, community-engaged learners
Long-term commitment to underserved care
 
Background: 
Malawi, known as the “Warm Heart of Africa,” is a landlocked country in southeastern Africa with strong community ties and significant public health challenges related to poverty, limited healthcare infrastructure, and workforce shortages.
Northern Malawi and the Ekwendeni community are predominantly rural, where many families must travel long distances to access medical care and where preventable illnesses such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, and childhood malnutrition remain prevalent.
Healthcare delivery in the region relies on a small number of hospitals and outreach programs serving large populations with limited resources.
Malawian clinicians, nurses, and healthcare workers lead patient care and public health efforts. Our students learn under their supervision and participate only within appropriate educational roles.
The challenges faced in Ekwendeni closely parallel those in rural Appalachia, including long travel distances to care, limited healthcare resources, workforce shortages, and high burdens of preventable disease. Learning in this setting equips students with adaptability, cultural humility, and problem-solving skills that directly strengthen their ability to serve underserved communities in West Virginia and beyond.
Additional details about our host hospital and planned activities are provided in the Program Details section.

What We Will Do in Malawi:
Learning
Supervised clinical exposure to tropical medicine and beyond
Public health education
Cultural and systems-based learning
Service 
Community-identified initiatives
Health education and outreach
This includes continuation of malaria education initiatives previously developed by Marshall students
Support for local clinics and programs 

What We Will Bring Back Home:
Educational presentations for students and community groups
Integration of global health lessons into rural Appalachian care
Continued malaria research and public health education
Training future Marshall medical students 
Shared reflections of experiences and lessons via essays, social media, and/or our program website

About the Trip - Learning & Serving in Ekwendeni, Malawi

This journey is not a traditional “medical mission” trip where outsiders set up temporary clinics. Instead, our focus is on learning and cultural exchange at an established local hospital and helping where we can. 

Host Site: Ekwendeni Mission Hospital: 
We will be hosted by Ekwendeni Mission Hospital (EMH), a small mission-run hospital in rural northern Malawi. Ekwendeni Mission Hospital is one of the oldest mission hospitals in Malawi. It has around 250 beds and serves a direct community of roughly 45,000 people (spread across 372 villages) with a wider referral area of up to 120,000. Despite its modest size and limited resources, the hospital cares for over 21,000 outpatients each year, admits about 7,000 patients, and delivers approximately 3,000 babies annually. 

Remarkably, there are usually only 1-2 medical doctors and 1 surgical doctor on staff (supported by around 100 nurses and workers) to handle this volume. The hospital is a ministry of the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian (CCAP) and serves a rural farming region where many people live in poverty. The region faces serious health challenges, including high rates of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, as well as widespread child malnutrition. These illnesses contribute to hardship in the community, and the hospital’s work is literally life-saving for many.

How We Minimize Burden and Work in Partnership: 
Given EMH’s small size and existing workload, we have been very mindful to plan our visit in a way that does not overburden the local staff or resources. We’ve been working closely with the hospital director and surgeon in Malawi to coordinate our activities. Our students will be divided into teams with a rotating schedule so that on any given day, some of us will be shadowing and assisting in the hospital, while others engage in service projects or community outreach. In this way, we can both learn from the hospital and give back without overwhelming their capacity. 

Planned Activities in Malawi: 
Clinical Rotations: 
Under the guidance of local doctors, nurses, and midwives, our students will rotate through the hospital’s four wards (pediatrics, maternity, male and female inpatient wards), observing and assisting with patient care. This will give us hands-on learning in a resource-limited setting and insight into Malawi’s healthcare system. We will be careful guests – helping where we can, but primarily there to learn and support the local providers.
In addition, all medical students will complete a global health curriculum, before leaving and while there, focusing on cultural competency, communication, common clinical diseases encountered, and more. 

Service Projects: 
While in Malawi, we hope to support Ekwendeni Mission Hospital by assisting with facility improvements and participating in its established outreach programs. 
One project team will repaint the pediatric ward to create a brighter, more welcoming environment for hospitalized children. 
Another group will assist with the hospital’s community health outreach efforts, including participating in tuberculosis screening clinics and malaria education programs in surrounding villages. By helping with screenings and providing educational materials, we hope to extend the hospital’s reach and support its ongoing public health initiatives. 
Additionally, we are planning to partner with the Ekwendeni School for the Blind, Deaf, and Children with Albinism, a local school that serves children with significant educational and social barriers. The school is currently in need of essential infrastructure improvements and classroom supplies. Our team hopes to help support the replacement of a deteriorating roof, provide chairs for student desks, and supply critical learning materials such as braille paper, bold-line exercise books, and felt-tip pens.

Community & Cultural Engagement: 
An important part of our mission is to build relationships and immerse ourselves in the local culture. We want to show appreciation for our hosts’ hospitality and foster camaraderie. To do this, we’ve planned some community activities – for instance, we hope to host a barbecue cookout/party for the hospital staff as a gesture of thanks and friendship. 
We also aim to organize friendly soccer matches in the evenings between our students and the hospital staff. 
Additionally, we will visit local schools to hold fun activity days with the children, encouraging them in their education and just sharing smiles and laughter. 
Finally, we will take some time to appreciate Malawi’s natural beauty and culture – including a group excursion to Lake Malawi, a retreat in the nearby mountains, and a visit to one of their national parks – experiences that will allow us to learn more about the country’s heritage and give our hard-working students a bit of rest and time to appreciate the beauty of Malawi.

Program Philosophy: 
The goal of Marshall for Malawi is to continue and build a respectful, long-term partnership rooted in learning and mutual exchange. We are traveling not to impose solutions, but to learn from Malawian clinicians and communities and to contribute where invited and appropriate.

This experience will strengthen us as physicians in training and better prepare us to serve underserved communities, particularly in Appalachia, by fostering adaptability, compassion, and systems-based thinking.


Long-Term Investment & Sustainable Impact in Malawi:
Our commitment to Malawi extends beyond short-term service and clinical exposure. Over the past several years, Marshall medical students have intentionally built ethical, sustainable, and locally guided partnerships that emphasize long-term capacity building rather than dependency. We strive to support initiatives that strengthen local healthcare systems and empower Malawian communities from within.
One meaningful example of this commitment is a Marshall medical student who, after a previous Malawi trip, founded the Global Medical Education Foundation (Global Med Ed), a nonprofit dedicated to financially supporting the medical education and training of Malawian students. Through this effort, approximately $17,000 has been directed to the Ekwendeni Health Sciences College to invest in future Malawian healthcare professionals who will serve their own communities long-term. This student will also be returning with our team, continuing a cycle of mentorship, partnership, and sustainable impact — a model we believe represents a responsible and effective approach to global health.

Why We Need Your Support:
As enthusiastic as we are, one reality we face is that we are all full-time medical students without any income. We have to budget tightly to afford our travel, lodging, and other expenses for this trip. All of the financial burden falls on each student. We are passionately committed to making this trip happen, but our personal funds are limited – and that in turn limits how much we can do to assist the hospital and community in Malawi. 

Ekwendeni Mission Hospital has never asked us to bring anything or pay for projects; they have welcomed us purely for the educational opportunity. However, because we have developed a close relationship with the staff there over time, we know about some of the pressing needs and ways we could help improve conditions for patients. We feel a strong desire to give back to this hospital and community that are graciously hosting us.

This is where we reach out to you, our friends, family, and community neighbors. We’re asking for your financial support to help us achieve two things: (1) cover some of the costs of our projects and activities in Malawi, so that we can make a tangible positive impact for the hospital, and (2) offset some of the costs for our student team, who are sacrificing time and money to participate in this service-learning experience. 

By relieving some of the financial burden, your support will enable us to focus on our mission and maximize what we can contribute in Malawi. In essence, we’re inviting our community to partner with us as we support a community in need across the globe – a way of extending our love and care to “our neighbors around the world,” in Malawi.

How You Can Help:
We have identified several specific areas of need and project ideas for which we are raising funds. Below is a list of items/initiatives that you can sponsor or contribute towards. You may indicate if you’d like your donation to go toward a particular item, or simply give to the general project fund (we will allocate it to the area of greatest need). Even a small contribution to any of these will make a meaningful difference:
Projected Student Costs:
The following estimates are provided to promote transparency. 
Our medical students are personally covering the majority of their travel and participation costs. Each student is responsible for approximately $3,500 in expenses, including airfare, lodging, meals, insurance, and required travel documentation. As full-time medical students living primarily on educational loans, this represents a significant financial commitment.We share this cost breakdown not to request full sponsorship of student travel, but to provide transparency and show where there are priority needs for student support.
